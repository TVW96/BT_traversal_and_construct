A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, often referred to as the left child and the right child. It is called "binary" because each node can have no more than two children.

Key Characteristics:
Hierarchical Structure: It starts with a single root node, and every node in the tree can act as a parent to other nodes.
Child Nodes: Each node can have up to two children:
Left Child
Right Child
Recursive Nature: Each subtree of a binary tree is itself a binary tree.
